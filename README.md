Hello User! This is HolyClicker, A remake of Cookie Clicker!
I was bored and decided to develop something new and I decided on a Cookie Clicker Game!
Inside of this game you can Level Up, Bake Cookies, Save Data, Load Data, Reset Data, Have a Username, Have stats to track!
This game isnt close to being as good as the original Cookie Clicker but sure! 
Its pretty good for me that is beggining Javascript!
